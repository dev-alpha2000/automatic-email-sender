## Overview

This project is an Automatic Email Sender application built using React. It allows users to send automated emails through a simple interface by integrating with an email service provider's API (e.g., SMTP, SendGrid, or NodeMailer). The project features a form for composing the email, selecting recipients, and triggering the sending process programmatically.

## Features

Email Composition: Users can compose an email by providing subject, message body, and recipient information.

Automated Email Sending: Programmatically send emails through integration with an email API or SMTP service.


Email Templates: Support for reusable email templates.

Recipient Management: Users can add multiple recipients for bulk email sending.

Status Notifications: Display the status of the email delivery (sent, failed).

Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI for mobile and desktop devices

## Installation

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-email-sender.git
cd react-email-sender
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up the email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, SMTP server) and configure the API keys or credentials in the .env file (or within your backend server).

Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

Compose Email: Fill out the form with the recipient's email address, subject, and message body.

Send: Once the form is submitted, the email will be sent using the configured email service API.

Check Status: Users will be notified whether the email was successfully sent or if there was an error.

## Dependencies

React: Frontend framework for building the UI.

Axios or Fetch API: For making API requests to the backend or email service provider.

Email API (SendGrid, SMTP, or NodeMailer): To handle the actual email sending process.

CSS or Styled Components: For styling the UI components and form.

## Email Service Setup
SendGrid: Configure your SendGrid account, get the API key, and add it to your environment variables.
SMTP: Use an SMTP server and credentials for secure email delivery.
NodeMailer: If using NodeMailer, ensure your backend is properly configured to handle requests.
Security Considerations
API Key Management: Never expose sensitive API keys in the frontend code. Store them in environment variables or a secure backend.
Spam Prevention: Add form validation and CAPTCHAs to prevent misuse of the email sender.
Email Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on the backend to avoid a
